when she was just a girl 
she expected the world 
but it flew away from her reach so 
she ran away in her sleep 
and dreamed of 
para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise 
every time she closed her eyes 

when she was just a girl 
she expected the world 
but it flew away from her reach 
and the bullets catch in her teeth 
life goes on, it gets so heavy 
the wheel breaks the butterfly 
every tear a waterfall 
in the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes 
in the night the stormy night away she'd fly 

and dreams of 
para-para-paradise 
para-para-paradise 
para-para-paradise 
oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
she'd dream of 
para-para-paradise 
para-para-paradise 
para-para-paradise 
oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh 

la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
and so lying underneath those stormy skies 
she'd say, "oh, ohohohoh i know the sun must set to rise" 

this could be 
para-para-paradise 
para-para-paradise 
this could be 
para-para-paradise 
oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
this could be 
para-para-paradise 
para-para-paradise 
this could be 
para-para-paradise 
oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh
